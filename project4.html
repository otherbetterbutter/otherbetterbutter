  <h1>Designing for Inclusivity</h1>
  <h2>UX/UI</h2>
  <p>The digital newsletter I designed aims to address the specific needs of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), ensuring accessibility and comfort. Careful selection of fonts, colors, and layout adheres to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, aiming to provide a clear, calm, and reassuring user experience.</p>
  <h3>Process</h3>
  <p>My design process involved in-depth research on ASD challenges, leading to deliberate choices in the newsletter's  features. These include confirmation buttons for reassurance, customizable options for user control, and simplified language to reduce cognitive overload, all to create a tailored user experience for individuals with ASD. aligning the newsletter's design with WCAG guidelines.</p>
