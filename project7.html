              <p>In creating the "Type Express" poster, I opted for bold yellow letters against a detailed, grayscale backdrop, giving the design a vibrant yet focused contrast. The oversized, overlapping letters are designed to evoke the energy and diversity of life, making the type itself an embodiment of the theme.</p>

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>Throughout my design process, I engaged in a rigorous exploration of color palettes and compositional structures to determine what best conveys the essence of the exhibition. By experimenting with various color combinations, I assessed their emotional resonance and visual impact, which was crucial in directing the viewer's attention and setting the tone for the event. The blue lines in one of the iterations represent my analytical approach to the layout, possibly incorporating design principles such as the golden ratio to ensure that the final composition is not only visually compelling but also harmoniously balanced.</p>
